    <string name="hint1exp">The start sensitivity is the minimum movement which will be considered a reaction. If TrackStarter isn\'t detecting your reaction, lower the sensitivity. If the app is detecting false starts which aren\'t false
        because it detects minor movements, increase the sensitivity. The default value is 1.</string>

    <string name="hint2exp">The false start sensitivity is the minimum movement which will be considered a reaction, if its detected between the SET and
     GO sound. It is higher than the start sensitivity so that moving into SET position wont be mistaken as a false start. The
    default value is 5.</string>

    <string name="hint3exp">The time calibration is an adjustment users can make if the reaction time is too high or too low. Increasing the value from 0 to 100 will add 0.100 to your reaction. Decreasing
        value from 0 to -100 will bring down the reaction by 0.100. Default is 0ms.</string>
