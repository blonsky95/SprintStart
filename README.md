# SprintStart
App for sprinters which uses accelerometers to measure reaction time.
The app plays the sounds On your marks, Set and GO. When the player moves (reacting to the GO sound) if the accelerometer detects a 
change in acceleration which exceeds the variable threshold, it will provide the time it took the user to react after the GO sound.
